# Implementation Plan: Export Analysis Context for LLM Conversations

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the "Export Analysis Context" feature in JavaSight. This feature will allow users to download a hierarchical markdown document containing analysis data at the project, module, package, and file levels. The exported document is intended to be used as context for AI chat conversations, enabling more effective analysis and planning of changes to the target codebase.

## 2. Frontend Components

### 2.1. Project Page Enhancement

- Add "Export Analysis Context" option to the dropdown menu on the project page
- Implement loading state and error handling for the export operation
- Add client-side functionality to initiate download when the menu option is clicked

### 2.2. UI/UX Considerations

- The dropdown button should show "Exporting..." state during the export process
- Disable the dropdown button during export operations to prevent multiple requests
- Display appropriate error messages if the export fails
- The exported file should automatically download as "context.md"

## 3. Backend API Addition

### 3.1. Export Context Endpoint

- Create a new API endpoint at `/api/projects/[id]/export-context` that:
  - Fetches project information from MongoDB
  - Retrieves all modules, packages, and files associated with the project
  - Generates a hierarchical markdown document
  - Serves the content for download

### 3.2. Data Structure

The exported markdown will follow this hierarchical structure:
```
# Project: [Project Name]
[Project analysis]

## Module: [Module Name]
[Module analysis]

### Package: [Package Name]
[Package analysis]

#### File: [File Name]
[File analysis]
```

## 4. Implementation Steps

### 4.1. Backend Implementation

1. Create the `/api/projects/[id]/export-context` route
2. Implement MongoDB queries to efficiently retrieve project, modules, packages, and files data
3. Generate properly formatted markdown with appropriate headers for each level
4. Configure the response with proper headers for file download
5. Add error handling for database connection issues and missing data

### 4.2. Frontend Implementation

1. Update the project page dropdown menu to include the "Export Analysis Context" option
2. Add state variables to track the export operation status
3. Implement the export handler function to call the backend API
4. Create the client-side download functionality
5. Handle different states of the export operation in the UI (loading, success, error)
6. Test the download functionality across different browsers

## 5. Error Handling

- Validate project ID before attempting to fetch data
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for various failure scenarios
- Add appropriate logging on the backend for debugging

## 6. Testing Plan

- Verify the export functionality for projects of various sizes
- Test with projects containing different numbers of modules, packages, and files
- Ensure proper handling of projects with missing analysis data
- Confirm the downloaded file contains correctly formatted markdown
- Validate that the exported content is useful for LLM context purposes

## 7. Process Flow

1. User clicks "Export Analysis Context" in the project page dropdown
2. UI enters "Exporting..." state
3. Frontend makes GET request to `/api/projects/[id]/export-context`
4. Backend retrieves hierarchical data from MongoDB
5. Backend generates formatted markdown document
6. Backend returns the markdown with appropriate headers for file download
7. Browser receives the response and initiates file download
8. User receives "context.md" file
9. UI returns to normal state

This implementation will provide users with a convenient way to export project analysis data for use in LLM chat conversations, enhancing their ability to get AI assistance with understanding and modifying their Java codebase.
